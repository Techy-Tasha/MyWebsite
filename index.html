      <h2>Learning to Program</h2>
      When I first decided to learn to program the task seemed immensely 
      overwhelming and it still does honestly.  The gateway of HTML akes it seemed as if it will all be that easy.  That was a lie, lol.  Beyond the complexity
      of learning CSS and then the beast that is JavaScript this whole process has
      been alot fun.  I am coming to realize that is the key to this whole thing,
      for me, at least.  The amount of fun I am having creating and learning far
      outways the roadblocks of my current understanding.
